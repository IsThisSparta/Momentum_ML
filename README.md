# Summary
The underlying data used/generated by the files is in the "releases" due to file size issues. To run the code files, the data folder must be unzipped and in the same directory as the code 
(follow the underlying folder structure).

The code files are intended to be run sequentially; "1. GetStockList", "2. TransformData", "3. MachineLearning".
