# AFM 423 Momentum Summative
This is a summative assignment for AFM 423. This contains the initial literature survey (GPR #1), testing of machine learning algorithms (the three sequential code files), and the final report (GPR #2).

The Jupyter Notebook coding files can be viewed in a markdown format with a clear process by just clicking on the files, or can be run by downloading them along with the data.

The underlying data used/generated by the code files is in "releases" due to file size issues. To run the code files, the data folder must be unzipped and in the same directory as the code 
(keep the same folder structure).

The code files are intended to be run sequentially: "1. GetStockList", "2. TransformData", "3. MachineLearning".
